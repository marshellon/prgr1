    "The network protocol that powers the web is actually quite simple and there is built-in support in Python called **sockets** which makes it very easy to make network connections and retrieve data over those sockets in a Python program. \n",
    "A socket is much like a file, except that a single socket provides a two-way connection between two programs. You can both read from and write to the same socket. If you write something to a socket, it is sent to the application at the other end of the socket. If you read from the socket, you are given the data which the other application has sent.\n",
    "But if you try to read a socket when the program on the other end of the socket has not sent any data, you just sit and wait. If the programs on both ends of the socket simply wait for some data without sending anything, they will wait for a very long time, so an important part of programs that communicate over the Internet is to have some sort of protocol. \n",
    "\n",
    "The HyperText Transfer Protocol is described in the following document: https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.txt. For example to request a document from a the web server bioinf.nl , we make a connection to the bioinf.nl server on port 80, and then send a line of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "    GET https://bioinf.nl/~fennaf/poem.txt HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTTP protocol says we must send the GET command followed by a blank line. `\\r\\n` signifies an EOL (end of line), so `\\r\\n\\r\\n` signifies nothing between two EOL sequences. That is the equivalent of a blank line. Since the internet does not speak 'unicode' but needs UTF-8 coded strings we use the method `.encode()` to encode the get command into a UTF-8 readable format for the server. (Which is more efficient to process)\n",

    "Once Once we send that blank line, we write a loop that receives data in 512-character chunks from the socket and prints the data out until there is no more data to read (i.e., the `recv()` returns an empty string). To make it a string in python we need to decode the data from UTF-8 to unicode using the method `.decode()`. When finished we can close the socket. "
