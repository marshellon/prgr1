    "# Python versus pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous courses you learned to process files line by line. You learned to extract information line based. A common way to extract information is using a for loop. In the following example a file named corpus is processed. The file contains *4 milion processing steps of recipes*. In the `python` way example the file is read line by line and the lines containing the word 'tomato' are stored in an array together with the index of the line. In the `pandas` way the file is not read line by line but processed vectorized. This is an important concept of pandas. \n",

    "Python for-loops are processed—One instruction, per one data element, per one moment in time, in order to produce one result. The advantage is that it is flexible — you may implement any operation on your data. The drawback is that you need many lines of code and it is not optimized for memory. "

The instruction f[f['clean'].str.contains('tomato')] is an example of such an instruction. It extracts all the sentences with the word tomato for all lines in the file f at once. In data processing vectorized instructions are favored over element wise instructions, since vectorized implementations allow paralel CPU usage."
